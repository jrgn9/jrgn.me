My personal website created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) 
and the [risotto theme](https://risotto.joeroe.io/).

## For my own use:

This is just a section for myself to remember how to use Hugo.

### Installing themes with Hugo
To install a theme, just find a fitting theme repository, download it and put it into the themes folder of your Hugo 
project. Then, you can set the theme in the .toml config file.
