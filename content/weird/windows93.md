[Windows 93](https://www.windows93.net/) is a website styled to look and work like an old school Windows OS. It is developed by [Jankenpopp](https://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Jankenpopp) and [Zombectro](https://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Zombectro). Windows 93 contains a lot of apps, which are mostly old memes.

The amount of stuff to explore in this acid trip version of Windows 95 is astounding! The amount of work put into this project is insane. And for what? A fantastic site! Art! Fun! Nostalgia! The OS is complete with games, bad jokes, a browser and even a dedicated chat room. The site just makes me speechless, you got to check it out yourself!
