I feel like the internet has gone to shit. Social media, walled gardens and capitalism at large are to blame. However, there are still some gold out there. So this is my project sharing all that fantastic weird stuff. The stuff which once made the internet fun and exciting. Stuff that I enjoy, and hopefully others do too. So let's keep the internet weird!
