# Hi, how are you

Hi, my name is JÃ¸rgen! I like to learn, I like computers and all the stuff you can do with them. That might be why I have a bachelor's degree in computer science as well as a degree as an elementary teacher. I am a musician, playing in bands and running a cultural collective/record label called [Hoppla Hesten](https://hopplahesten.net).

This is my personal website. Here you can find more information about me, read some of my rambling thoughts, check out cool stuff I find or take a look at my projects.
