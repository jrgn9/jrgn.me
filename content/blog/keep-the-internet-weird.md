I've been kind of obsessed by the state of the internet lately. And I've been wanting to share my obsession for a while. Both writing about it, but also through the project I have called [keep the internet weird](/weird/).

## Enshittification
My obsession got fueled when Cory Doctorow [coined the term "Enshittification"](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys). With that, Cory Doctorow had put what I've been feeling for a while into words. I would highly recommend reading that article. For those unaware, this is the original meaning of the term "enshittification":

> Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.

Summarize enshittification on the internet......

## The Rot Economy
I then ran into Ed Zitron's post about [The Rot Economy](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/) not long after. Further expanded on this topic... Recap...

## The corporate internet
So how does all this fit into the state of the internet which I have been obsessing over? Facebook (and social media in general) marked the start of what I like to call the corporate internet. 

## Let's keep the internet weird
Instead of just whining about how shit all platforms have become, and reminisce about how everything was better before, I've decided I want to do something proactive. I am diving into the depths of internet, exploring all the fun, interesting and useless out there like it was the early 2000s. Anything besides the corporate and sterile internet. And I am going to write about it and report my findings over at [keep the internet weird](/weird/).
