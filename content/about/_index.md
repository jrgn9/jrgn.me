## Experience and education

I have a bachelor's degree as an elementary school teacher. I've worked as a teacher for over five years and taught most subjects. However, my main subjects are science, music and math. I also have extra courses in pedagogical use of IT in school, and a lot of experience with that. As my background indicates, I love to both learn and teach. I thrive in collaborative environments where people can provide me with new knowledge, and I can provide others with the same.

In 2021, I decided to jump ship and do something else. IT has always been a huge interest of mine, so a bachelor's degree in computer science made sense. The degree provided me with knowledge in many different areas. Like programming (Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Bash), algorithms and data structures, databases, AI, software testing, web development, computer security and much more. I prefer working on backend. Pure coding, terminals and servers are my kind of jam.

I started working as a software engineer at [Nevion](https://nevion.com/) in august 2024.

I mostly work on backend stuff, with Java being my main language, along with a lot of Bash for scripting. I have worked a lot on web development through my studies, especially with C# and ASP .NET Core. I have mainly focused on backend and testing. I have mostly worked with Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum. I'm into system administration and self-hosting, and I enjoy working with tools like Docker and Git. Beyond the tech, my background in teaching has given me strong communication and teamwork skills, making me great at collaborating and solving problems creatively.

## Music and organization
I love music and have been playing in bands since 2008. My go-to stuff are in the alternative punk, indie and garage rock landscape, but I listen to a lot of different music. I play bass and sing in [Ultrakill](https://www.hopplahesten.net/band/ultrakill), I'm the lead singer of [HRPS](https://www.hopplahesten.net/band/hrps/), and play bass in [Honecker](https://www.hopplahesten.net/band/honecker/). 

Back in the days, we were a bunch of people playing in bands without the means to record and release music. So in 2011 we started [Hoppla Hesten](https://www.hopplahesten.net/), a cultural collective, record label and voluntary organization. I've been leading this organization since start. We support bands, release music and do a lot of administrative music work. Check out all our releases on [bandcamp](https://hopplahesten.bandcamp.com) or wherever you stream music.
